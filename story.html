        <p>On the island of Crete there lived a Minotaur, a fierce animal that was half man and half bull. The individuals of the island of Crete were terrified of the Minotaur; it adored nothing more than to devour on human flesh. They asked their ruler, Ruler Minos, to arrange that the animal be slaughtered, but the Ruler chosen against this. Instead, he developed a plan to detain the Minotaur. To pass on at the hands of the Minotaur would be one of the most awful passings possible, and Lord Minos accepted that his adversaries merited to meet such a fate. He enlisted the assistance of Daedalus, a skilled designer, innovator and expert, and inquired him to construct a maze – a labyrinth of sections that would be so complex that it would be practically impossible for anyone (or anything) to ever find a way out. </p>

        <p>Daedalus did as Ruler Minos asked and after, that taking after the King's enlightening, he allured the Minotaur into the maze by taking off a huge heap of new meat in its middle. Once the Minotaur was within the maze the animal was incapable to elude. Ruler Minos was pleased. Anybody who was sent to the maze would be caught and inevitably they would be found by the Minotaur who would eat them lively. Presently he had the culminate discipline for his foes! Choosing he had no advance utilize for Daedalus, the Lord tossed him into the maze along side his child Icarus. The Lord anticipated that the creator and his child would be found by the Minotaur and eaten. Instep, obscure to the lord, they gotten away. After all, Daedalus had built the maze and knew his way around!

        <p>Once out of the maze Deadulus and Icarus carefully made their way to the shore of the island and considered on what to do another. The trees and bushes encompassing the shoreline would give an perfect asylum for the time being. They might conceivably survive for months or a long time without being seen. But who would need to live like that – hiding away trusting they would not be captured? They required to fi nd a way to take off the island, but how? They seem not swim, the closest arrive was too distant absent, and they would never make it. They seem not take off by dispatch; all vessels were controlled by Ruler Minos. Daedalus gazed up at the sky and the seagulls that circled overhead. In the event that as it were he was as free as a winged creature. In the event that as it were he and his child may fair fl y absent … and after that he had an thought which was both brilliant and yearning. He would construct a combine of wings!

        <p>It would take a few time, days, weeks indeed, but he would construct a match of wings for his child and himself – precisely the same as the wings of a seagull but on a much bigger scale. Scattered around the shoreline were seagull feathers. Daedalus educating his child to gather as numerous as he seem fi nd. He worked carefully to construct the wings, examining the precise point and shape of the seagulls and analyzing how the fowls fl ew. At final, six weeks after they had gotten away from the maze, the wings were ready. 'With these wings you'll fl y like a bird,' Daedalus told his child, 'but take care. Make beyond any doubt you are doing not fl y as well near to the Sun. In case you are, doing the wax that holds the plumes together will melt.' Icarus gestured rapidly. In truth he was scarcely tuning in.

        <p>As well late Icarus realized his wings were softening. He had flew too close to the Sun. With each frantic swoop of his arms, more plumes fell and before long his arms were nearly uncovered. Down and down and down went Icarus... 'Father!' he yelled some time recently falling with a overwhelming sprinkle into the ocean. His few remaining feathers floated on the surface of the water as he sank. Daedalus could only observe powerlessly and his heart felt as overwhelming as a stone as he flew onwards, leaving his child behind.
